# Konzernverantwortungsinitiative

* Piggyback on poster campaign

* Date: 

Ozeane versauert --- Korallen gestorben --- Oelkonzern haftet
Methan entwichen --- Gletscher geschmolzen --- Gaskonzern haftet
Atmosphaere veraendert --- Temperatur erhoeht --- Kohlekonzern haftet

## Carbon Cycle bathtub model

* Something's already there:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt0v4YAAVg>,
  but needs to be expanded, modernized and dramatized.

### Pools

* Pool --- Lithosphere
* Bucket #1 --- Atmosphere
* Bucket #2 --- Ocean

### Fluxes

* Atmosphere -> Ocean: Dissolution
* Valve Pool -> Atmosphere: Fossile fuel extraction
* Use showerhead analogy: We try to plug individual holes,
  where we should just close the valve

### Species at risk

* Atmosphere: Temperature, polar bears, humans
* Ocean: Corals, Plankton with CaCO3 skeletons, ...


### Problems with bathtub model

* Might be perceived as rising sea levels -> Use terrarium model instead?

## House on fire

* House with gas conduit
* Close main valve before anything else
