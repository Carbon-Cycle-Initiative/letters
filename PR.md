# Konzernverantwortungsinitiative

* Piggyback on poster campaign

* Date: 

Ozeane versauert --- Korallen gestorben --- Oelkonzern haftet
Methan entwichen --- Gletscher geschmolzen --- Gaskonzern haftet
Atmosphaere veraendert --- Temperatur erhoeht --- Kohlekonzern haftet

## Carbon Cycle bathtub model

* Something's already there:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nt0v4YAAVg>,
  but needs to be expanded, modernized and dramatized.

### Pools

* Pool --- Lithosphere
* Bucket #1 --- Atmosphere
* Bucket #2 --- Ocean

### Fluxes

* Atmosphere -> Ocean: Dissolution
* Valve Pool -> Atmosphere: Fossile fuel extraction
* Use showerhead analogy: We try to plug individual holes,
  where we should just close the valve

### Species at risk

* Atmosphere: Temperature, polar bears, humans
* Ocean: Corals, Plankton with CaCO3 skeletons, ...


### Problems with bathtub model

* Might be perceived as rising sea levels -> Use terrarium model instead?

## House on fire

* House with gas conduit
* Close main valve before anything else


## Vehicle trail

* Visualize the amount of air becoming unusable trailing a vehicle
  (car, plane, ...).  Or a passenger in a vehicle.  Since airliners
  travel much faster than cars but have similar/smaller gas mileage
  per person, they may end up with an advantage here.

  Various CO2 thresholds can be used.  E.g. doubling concentration,
  concentration that becomes a know health hazard, 100% concentration.


## Sell a greenhouse effect demonstration kit

!!!

* Bottle, soda, vinegar, thermometers.
* Ensure the experiment is well tested and yields reproducible results.
