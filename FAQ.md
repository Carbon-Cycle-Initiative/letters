# General

* Q: What is the Carbon Cycle?
* A: The carbon cycle is the movement of carbon (C) between land
     (i.e., the Earth's soil, crust, mantle etc.), atmosphere and 
     oceans.  Movements ('fluxes') between these reservoirs of are measured
     in billions of tons (Gt) of C per year (GtC/yr).  
     
     In the context of this project, we focus in particular on the
     flux from land to the atmosphere by extraction and burning of
     fossile fuels.

     See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle).

* Q: How can I verify that CO2 is a greenhouse gas?
* A: The simplest experiment is with two identical bottles, one
     of them containg normal air and the second one air with elevated
     CO2 concentration.  If you expose both bottles to direct sunlight,
     the one with more CO2 will heat more.  The internet has
     several instructions and videos for this or similar experiments.
  
* Q: But CO2 is only a trace gas with only a few parts per million
  in the atmosphere, it cannot possibly influence the climate!
* A: Atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased from a stabilized
  level of 280ppm before the industrial revolution to over 400ppm
  as of 2020.  While compared to oxygen or nitrogen the CO2 concentration
  is low, the relative change is over 40%, a substantial number.
  We encourage you to do the two bottle experiment.



# Paradoxes

* Q: Why do I need to go through all kinds of red tape and bureaucracy
  to get a permit to build a shack in my backyard while at
  the same time we allow big concerns to modify the planet's 
  atmosphere without an environmental impact assessment?
* A: We don't know.  Perhaps ask your lawmakers.

# Motivation

* Q: Aren't we all responsible?
* A: Yes and no.  There are many people who have legitimate reasons to
  emit CO2 and have little choice.  Some people emit a lot, many
  people emit very little.

  If you can reduce or compensate your personal carbon footprint, by
  all means go for it.  If everyone does it according to the 5%/year
  reduction schedule, great, then the extractor
  companies only need to follow the market development.

* Q: But the fossile fuel companies just extract the stuff from the earth,
  they don't burn it's not them who creates the emissions!
* A: Correct, but besides the point.  We need to reduce the flux from
  the geosphere (i.e., carbon bound in solid form) to the atmosphere.  
  Since almost all of extracted fuels are eventually burnt, the flux 
  into the atmosphere is the same as the sum of all fuels extracted by 
  all extractor companies.
  
  The advantages of tackling the problem at the source level are:
  * It is vastly more practical and effective to deal with a few hundred
    extractor companies than with billions of companies and individuals
    burning off the fuels.
  * It is fairer because we implement a flat 5% reduction per
    year for all extractors equally.
  * The extractors have by far more concentrated financial and
    human resources to tackle the problem than the consumers.

# Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels besides global warming

* Q: Is CO2 toxic?
* A: Even at the current elevated levels in the atmosphere, it *appears*
  that CO2 is not toxic for humans.  However, no studies have been
  conducted where humans have been exposed to elevated CO2 levels
  for entire lifetimes, so technically we can't be sure.  
  
  [Studies hint](https://www.businessinsider.com/office-air-co2-levels-making-workers-tired-2017-11) 
  that elevated CO2 levels reduce cognitive performance.

* Q: What about plant growth?
* A: Probably grow somewhat faster, TODO: references

* Q: What effect do rising CO2 levels have on animals?
* A: We don't really know.  We consider it the extractor companies' 
     responsibility to asses the impact of CO2 concentration on
     the worldwide fauna *before* increasing it.


# Effects of elevated CO2 levels in the ocean

Water dissolves CO2, however this increases acidity. 
Unfortunately, this creates a whole host of problems
by itself known as 
[Ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification)
