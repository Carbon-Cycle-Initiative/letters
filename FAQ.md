# General

* Q: What is the Carbon Cycle?
* A: The carbon cycle is the movement of carbon (C) between land
     (i.e., the Earth's soil, crust, mantle etc.), atmosphere and 
     oceans.  Movements ('fluxes') between these reservoirs of are measured
     in billions of tons (Gt) of C per year (GtC/yr).  
     
     In the context of this project, we focus in particular on the
     flux from land to the atmosphere by extraction and burning of
     fossile fuels.

     See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle).
     TODO: Book references
     
* Q: How can I verify that CO2 is a greenhouse gas?
* A: The simplest experiment is with two identical bottles, one
     of them containg normal air and the second one air with elevated
     CO2 concentration.  If you expose both bottles to direct sunlight,
     the one with more CO2 will heat more.  The internet has
     several instructions and videos for this or similar experiments.
  
* Q: But CO2 is only a trace gas with only a few parts per million
  in the atmosphere, it cannot possibly influence the climate!
* A: Atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased from a stabilized
  level of 280ppm before the industrial revolution to over 400ppm
  as of 2020.  While compared to oxygen or nitrogen the CO2 concentration
  is low, the relative change is over 40%, a substantial number.
  We encourage you to do the two bottle experiment.



# Paradoxes

This section points out some of the paradoxical advantages fossile 
fuel extractors still have over other types of energy
or the economy in general.  It is a key goal of this initiative
to create fairness in the energy market.  In fact,
fairness would make any fossile fuel extraction business 
immediately economically unviable without compensation.

* Q: Why do I need to go through all kinds of red tape and bureaucracy
     to get a permit to build a shack in my backyard while at
     the same time we allow big concerns to modify the planet's 
     atmosphere without an environmental impact assessment?
* A: We don't know.  Perhaps ask your lawmakers.

* Q: What kind of liability insurance is required to extract fossile
     fuels?
* A: There are no requirements for liability insurance that would cover
     the full consequences detailed above, including global warming.  
     Most other enterprises, in particular also renewable energy projects,
     face strict requirements for liability insurance covering all
     possible consequences.

* Q: What kind of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is required for
     raising the CO2 level of the planet?
* A: None.  Likewise, for most other enterprises, EIAs are required
     even for very small scale projects.

* Q: What is the burden of proof for EIAs for small scale projects?
* A: The project proponent has to prove that his project doesn't 
     negatively affect the environment.

* Q: What is the burden of proof for EIAs for fossile fuel projects?
* A: Fossile fuel extractors don't even need to conduct EIAs for
     bringing additional carbon into circulation in the carbon cycle.
     This is despite overwhelming evidence for all the negative consequences.

# Burden of proof


**We need to reverse the burden for the environmental impact of
fossile fuel extraction.**  

This is so obvious that maybe it is sometimes overlooked.

For any other projects, even on very small scales, in modern 
legislations the proponent is required to conduct an EIA
to prove that there are no untenable negative consequences on the
environment.  Given the massive scale and importance of potential negative 
consequences, this should obviously be the same for fossile fuel
extraction.  

To be very clear:  Fossile fuel extractors should be required 
to conduct an EIA to prove beyond reasonable doubt that 
* their activities are:
  * Safe for glaciers.
  * Do not alter global weather patterns.
  * Do not alter ocean currents.
* Any disturbance of the global Carbon Cycle, including tipping to
  new stability points, can be ruled out.
* Impacts on oceanic acidity are negligible and safe for all marine life,
  in particular calcifying organisms like corals.
* There are no negative consequences for food chains, neither oceanic
  nor land-based.
* There are no direct negative consequences for the human body, neither
  from higher temperatures nor elevated atmospheric CO2 levels.
* There are no direct negative consequences for any other plant or 
  animal species, neither from higher temperatures nor elevated 
  atmospheric CO2 levels.
* Etc. etc.
Any such EIA must be conducted *prior* to proceeding to bring carbon
into circulation.

# The reduction schedule

* Q: Why 5%/year?
* A: This is a preliminary number and may actually not be 
     enough.  We ask fossile fuel extractors live up to their
     responsibility and reduce faster if necessary
     or face consequences.

     TODO: Put numbers from IPCC/remaining CO2 budget etc.

# Motivation

* Q: Why are you doing this?
* A: Because, unfortunately, politics and the fossile fuel industry
     as of 2020 leaves us little choice.

* Q: Aren't we all responsible?
* A: Yes and no.  There are many people who have legitimate reasons to
  emit CO2 and have little choice.  Some people emit a lot, many
  people emit very little.

  If you can reduce or compensate your personal carbon footprint, by
  all means go for it.  If everyone does it according to the 5%/year
  reduction schedule, great, then the extractor
  companies only need to follow the market development.

* Q: But the fossile fuel companies just extract the stuff from the earth,
  they don't burn it's not them who creates the emissions!
* A: Correct, but besides the point.  We need to reduce the flux from
  the geosphere (i.e., carbon bound in solid form) to the atmosphere.  
  Since almost all of extracted fuels are eventually burnt, the flux 
  into the atmosphere is the same as the sum of all fuels extracted by 
  all extractor companies.  Therefore, if we reduce the flux into
  the atmosphere, the extraction from the geosphere has to reduce
  by the same amount.

  Literally, we need to attack the problem at the roots, which are the
  fossile sources.
  
* Q: What are other advantages of tackling the problem at the source?
* A:
  * It is vastly more practical and effective to deal with a few hundred
    extractor companies than with billions of companies and individuals
    burning off the fuels.
  * It is fairer because we implement a flat 5% reduction per
    year for all extractors equally.
  * The extractors have immense financial and human resources to address 
    the problem.
  * Another way of looking at it is:

     Imagine you have a city with a gas distribution network.  The 
     city is hit by an earthquake; some pipes break and start
     leaking.  Obviously, the first thing to is to close
     the main valve(s) where the gas enters the network.
     
     The fossile fuel extractors are like the main valves.  We
     have to close them, the faster the better.

# Legal

* Q: Can we actually enforce the reduction schedule?
* A: We have no other choice than to try.  We can obviously only do it with
     the support of lots of people.  The percentage of people 'alarmed'
     about climate change in recent polls (3/2020) should be largely
     sufficient to have a significant impact.
     
* Q: Are existing laws sufficient to enforce the reduction schedule?
* A: Yes, we do believe so, at least in a number of countries.  There
     are laws against endangerment of life or environment which could
     apply.  Generally, managers who knowingly put the success of their
     company in jeopardy would be committing an offense.

* Q: Aren't you trying to change laws retroactively?
* A: It's sufficient to apply existing laws NOW and change them if
     necessary to enforce the reduction schedule.  We do think that
     a strong moral responsibility of companies in the fossile fuel
     business exists, because the dangers of CO2 in the atmosphere
     have been publicly known for at least 40 years now.  Managers of
     big international companies should be held to very high moral
     and legal standards.  For the same reason, we don't think that
     any advance notice is necessary.


# Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels besides global warming

* Q: Is CO2 toxic?
* A: Even at the current elevated levels in the atmosphere, it *appears*
  that CO2 is not toxic for humans.  However, no studies have been
  conducted where humans have been exposed to elevated CO2 levels
  for entire lifetimes, so technically we can't be sure.  
  
  [Studies hint](https://www.businessinsider.com/office-air-co2-levels-making-workers-tired-2017-11) 
  that elevated CO2 levels reduce cognitive performance.

* Q: What about plant growth?
* A: Probably grow somewhat faster, TODO: references

* Q: What effect do rising CO2 levels have on animals?
* A: We don't really know.  We consider it the extractor companies' 
     responsibility to asses the impact of CO2 concentration on
     the worldwide fauna *before* increasing it.


# Effects of elevated CO2 levels in the ocean

Water dissolves CO2, however this increases acidity. 
Unfortunately, this creates a whole host of problems
by itself known as 
[Ocean acidification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification).
