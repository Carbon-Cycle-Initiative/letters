# Letters

Letters to directors and officers of fossile energy 
companies, government executives etc. asking them to 
wind down emissions.

We mainly target extractors because as of 2020,
no substantial reduction can be achieved without 
reduction of extraction.


# Watchlist

Companies which engage in harmful activities of extracting,
refining, distributing etc. fossile fuels are put on
the watchlist.

## Extractors

* List fossile fuel companies with D&Os and contact
  data as far as available

* Prioritize by amount of GHG extracted/yr, including 
  CH4 and waste products (including on-site emissions,
  e.g. shale).

## TODO: Letter to Refineries, Distributors

Refineries, distributors contribute to the problem by 
bringing fossile fuels into circulation.  If the
reduction targets are to be achieved, they'll obviously
need to wind down their activities as well.


## TODO: Letter to Banks

Put them on notice to move on to financing non-fossile or negative
emission projects.  There are plenty.

## TODO: Letter to insurance companies

* Cancel directors and officers insurance for blacklisted
  companies.
* Cancel any insurance for any fossile extraction project
  that is not winding down, in particular strictly no
  insurance for new projects.



# TODOs

* In letters, add references for the most important concepts
  (see IPCC, NOAA, carbon cycle book etc.)?


## Distribution of letters

* Write a small software to customize letters for recipients
  (replace `SIR_MADAM` `COMPANY` with elements from watchlist),
  and convert them to nice PDFs.
* Find funding to actually send the letters

## Political campaign(s)

* Need to set the legal framework for the reduction 
  schedule (down to zero by 2040, possibly faster)
  in national laws of the most important countries
* Countries can have effects outside their borders
  by imposing tariffs and freezing assets of 
  violators.
* Laws need to be _explicit_ so that
  government executives have no choice but to
  enforce them.
