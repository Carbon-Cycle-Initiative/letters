# Emissions / extraction tracking

The main point of this effort is that, in addition to tracking and
accounting for carbon emissions, we also need to track, and,
eventually account, for carbon *extraction* from the lithosphere.  The
reason is that almost everything which is being extracted eventually
ends up in the atmosphere or ocean.

Accounting for extraction is, in principle, much easier, because there
are only relatively few players, namely the big oil, gas and coal
companies.  If we can force these companies to reduce fossil extraction,
we also autoatically also reduce emissions.  If we cap emissions,
we cap extraction because storage facilities are very limited compared
to the total carbon flux.  So both are essentially equivalent.

Thus, *now* is the time to warn the extractors that they really have
to cap and reduce their extraction operations.  Note that this doesn't
even necessarily mean less revenues or profits for them, because as 
supply becomes more scarce, prices will obviously rise.

We suggest to move from cap-and-trade of emissions to cap-and-trade for
extraction rights.  This is much easier to implement, much fairer, and
easier to monitor provided that all countries collaborate.


## Fossil extractors with intentions to compensate

Below is a list of fossil extraction companies who announced intentions
to compensate for the fuels they extract.  Only companies 
committing to 'scope 3' targets are listed.  Scope 3 means compensation
of emissions from all fuels extracted, including those burnt by customers.
Notes:
* As of 2020, the fossil fuel extractors only made non-binding announcements
  for the far future (typically, 2040 or 2050).  It is important to
  clarify that additionally we need binding and sufficient reduction 
  targets for next year and the entire ramp down to zero.
* It is very likely that we'll also need 'scope 4' compensation, i.e. 
  compensation of emissions the extractor plus customers already caused
  in the past.

## 2020

* Royal Dutch Shell, UK/Netherlands, 4/2020, <https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-emissions-idUSKCN21Y0MW> 
* Occidental Petroleum Corporation, US/California, 11/2020, <https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/occidental-is-first-u-s-oil-major-to-target-net-zero-emissions-1.1520533>

# Letters

Letters to directors and officers of fossile energy 
companies, government executives etc. asking them to 
wind down emissions.

We mainly target extractors because as of 2020,
no substantial reduction can be achieved without 
reduction of extraction.


# Watchlist

Companies which engage in harmful activities of extracting,
refining, distributing etc. fossile fuels are put on
the watchlist.

Wikipedia has a [List of largest oil and gas companies by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_oil_and_gas_companies_by_revenue).  The list has a significant long
tail, so we'll really have to write all of them.  The list is led by Saudi,
Chinese, US, Kuwait and UK companies.  

TODO: Put all of them on the watchlist, including contacts of directors
and officers.  __Use only public sources and cite them__.

## Extractors

* List fossile fuel companies with D&Os and contact
  data as far as available

* Prioritize by amount of GHG extracted/yr, including 
  CH4 and waste products (including on-site emissions,
  e.g. shale).

## TODO: Letter to Refineries, Distributors

Refineries, distributors contribute to the problem by 
bringing fossile fuels into circulation.  If the
reduction targets are to be achieved, they'll obviously
need to wind down their activities as well.


## TODO: Letter to Banks

Put them on notice to move on to financing non-fossile or negative
emission projects.  There are plenty.

## TODO: Letter to insurance companies

* Cancel directors and officers insurance for blacklisted
  companies.
* Cancel any insurance for any fossile extraction project
  that is not winding down, in particular strictly no
  insurance for new projects.



# TODOs

* In letters, add references for the most important concepts
  (see IPCC, NOAA, carbon cycle book etc.)?


## Distribution of letters

* Write a small software to customize letters for recipients
  (replace `SIR_MADAM` `COMPANY` with elements from watchlist),
  and convert them to nice PDFs.
* Find funding to actually send the letters

## Political campaign(s)

* Need to set the legal framework for the reduction 
  schedule (down to zero by 2040, possibly faster)
  in national laws of the most important countries
* Countries can have effects outside their borders
  by imposing tariffs and freezing assets of 
  violators.
* Laws need to be _explicit_ so that
  government executives have no choice but to
  enforce them.
