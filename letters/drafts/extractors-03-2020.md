Dear SIR_MADAM,

as you are certainly aware, the global carbon cycle is
out of balance causing several potentially catastrophic effects
including, but not limited to:
* A strong rise of average temperatures (global warming),
* A change in the pH value of oceans (ocean acidification),
* Extinction of land and sea animal and plant species.

Your company COMPANY, engages in activities of extracting
fossile fuels which contribute to said imbalance of the carbon cycle.

This letter is to put you, your employees, your company 
and your shareholders on notice that given the 
urgency of the situation, we need to insist that
you start winding down said activities.

Said wind-down is to commence with immediate effect and to
be finished by the year 2040 at the latest.  

_The wind-down
schedule requires you to reduce your company's extraction of
carbon-based fuels by 5% every year relative to a baseline
of the corresponding average between 2010 and 2020._

_If scientific research shows that the above schedule is not
enough to avert global catastrophe, we reserve the right
to accelerate the wind-down schedule or require
you to implement negative carbon emission technologies
at any time._

We understand that your company draws a substantial part
of its profits from your activity of extracting fossile fuels.
We think however, that a 20 year wind-down period is more
than enough to allow you to restructure your company to 
draw profits from other business areas, e.g. from
renewable energies.

We would also like to mention that as a director or officer
of a large international company, you have a responsibility
to be aware of the consequences of your business.  The 
severe negative consequences of excessive CO2 emissions 
have been publicly knowledge for more than 40 years.  The
fact that you didn't follow up until now can and will be
interpreted as gross negligence in certain jurisdictions
and will already *now* expose you to drastic legal sanctions.

In the coming years we will work with legislators and 
governments to mandate above-mentioned wind-down worldwide.
Again due to the urgency of the situation, this mandate will
have no choice than to impose severe fines for non-compliant
companies and individuals.

It is important to emphasize the urgency of the situation and 
that you are required to act immediately.  
This is due to the fact that the entire planet is facing catastrophic 
climate change if you fail to act.  Surely you will understand 
that avoiding this catastrophe is more important than your ability 
to continue your business "as usual".

We are sending this
letter to you and to other companies we have identified as
engaging in the same or similar activities.

To be very clear: If you fail to act NOW, you expose 
yourself, your company, shareholders and employees to 
crushing and potentially fatal legal and economic sanctions.

Possible sanctions include, but are not limited to:
* Payment of compensatory and punitive damages
* Freezing of company and private assets
* Barring of your company and personnel from doing business
  in certain jurisdictions and worldwide
* Prison

It's time for you and COMPANY to find business areas which
do not threaten the livelihood of the entire human race.  There
are plenty available.

Sincerely,
Citizens concerned about climate change
