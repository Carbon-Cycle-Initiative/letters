DRAFT letter to directors/officers of fossile fuel extractor companies

Dear DIRECTOROFFICER,

as you are no doubt aware, the global carbon cycle is
out of balance causing several potentially catastrophic effects
including, but not limited to:
* A strong rise of average temperatures (global warming),
* A decrease of the pH value of oceans (ocean acidification),
* Extinction of land and sea animal and plant species.

Your company, COMPANY, engages in activities of extracting
fossile fuels which contribute to said imbalance of the carbon cycle.

This letter is to put you, COMPANY, your employees,
and your shareholders on formal notice that you must now
start winding down said activities or compensate their
disastrous effects.

Given the well-known urgency of the situation, said wind-down is 
to commence with immediate effect and to be finished by the year 
2040 at the latest.  

The wind-down
schedule will require your company to reduce its extraction of
carbon-based fuels by 5% every year relative to a baseline
of the corresponding average between 2010 and 2020.

__If scientific research shows that the above schedule is not
enough to avert global catastrophe, we may be forced to
to accelerate the wind-down schedule or require
you to implement negative carbon emission technologies
at any time.__

We understand that your company draws a substantial part
of its profits from your activity of extracting fossile fuels.
However, we consider a 20 year wind-down period more
than enough to allow you to transform your company to 
draw profits from other business areas, e.g. from
renewable energies.  Due to the need for a reduced supply, 
we expect fossil fuel prices to increase, allowing similar
or higher revenues even as your production needs to reduce.
You can use part of these higher revenues to create a negative
CO2 flux (i.e. out of the atmosphere).  This may allow you to
maintain or even increase your fossil fuel production levels.


It is important to mention that as a director or officer
of a large international company, you have and always had
a strong responsibility
to be aware of the consequences of your business.  The 
severe negative consequences of excessive CO2 emissions 
have been public knowledge for more than 40 years.  Your
failure to act decisively until now could therefore be interpreted
in some jurisdictions as gross negligence 
and could already expose you to drastic legal sanctions.

In the coming years we will work with legislators and 
governments to mandate the above-mentioned wind-down schedule worldwide.
Due to the urgency of the situation, governments will
have no choice than to impose severe sanctions for non-compliant
companies and individuals.

It is important to emphasize, however, that despite a possible
delay in lawmaking, you are required to act immediately.
Surely you will understand that avoiding a global
climate catastrophe is more important than your company's
ability to continue its business "as usual".

We are sending this
letter to you and to other companies we have identified as
engaging in the same or similar activities.

If you fail to act NOW, you expose 
yourself, your company, shareholders and employees to 
crushing and potentially fatal legal and economic sanctions
including, but not limited to:
* Payment of large compensatory and punitive damages
* Freezing of company and private assets
* Barring of your company and personnel from doing business
  in certain jurisdictions or worldwide
* Prison

If you were to fail to act decisively now, you would devastate
you shareholder's value.  This would surely expose you to billions
of dollers in shareholder derivative suits for your breach
of fiduciary duty.

It's time for you and COMPANY to move to business areas which
do not threaten the livelihood of the entire human race.  There
are plenty of lucrative areas you can go into and you have
enough time and financial resources to do so.  

Given the facts available to you and the urgency of the 
situation, there cannot be any excuse for a further delay of
starting the above described transformation of your company.

To be very clear:  You must commence the reduction or
compensation schedule for fossile fuel extraction NOW or else you and your 
company face dire consequences.

Sincerely,  
Citizens concerned about climate change
